# Python Data Analysis Example with Pandas and Seaborn

## Overview

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks designed for easily running on Google Colab and VS Code, focusing on data analysis and visualization examples using `pandas` and `seaborn`. It's a practical way to explore datasets, uncover insights, and visualize trends without the need for local environment setup. Specifically, this project utilizes machine learning databases provided from the Dow Jones index, offering a hands-on experience with real-world financial data. We simplify access to these databases using `wget`, allowing for straightforward data retrieval directly within the notebooks.

Here's a quick demo
